# Active Context: mediabros_apis

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing codebase to facilitate future development and maintenance. This involves creating a set of documentation files based on the Memory Bank template to capture the project's architecture, context, and status.

Parallel to this, there is an ongoing effort to bolster the project's testing infrastructure. The current work involves setting up both unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Documentation:** Initiated the creation of a `docs` folder and foundational documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`).
- **Unit Testing:** A comprehensive suite of unit tests has been developed for utility and authentication functions located in `app.py`. These tests are in `tests/test_app_functions.py` and make extensive use of mocking.
- **Integration Testing Setup:** The groundwork for integration testing has been laid by adding `pytest` and `pytest-chalice` to the development dependencies. A `tests` directory, `__init__.py`, and a basic `conftest.py` with app fixtures have been created.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Initial Documentation:** Finish generating the remaining documents in the Memory Bank template (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2.  **Write Integration Tests:** Identify the primary API endpoints from `app.py` and `serverless.yml` and create integration tests to validate their behavior from end to end.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** The development dependencies for testing (`pytest`, `pytest-chalice`) have been added to `Pipfile` but need to be installed by running `pipenv install --dev`.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Documentation Strategy:** We are proceeding with the Memory Bank template to structure our understanding of the project. This structured approach is preferred for clarity and consistency.
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest` is the chosen framework for both unit and integration testing, leveraging plugins like `pytest-chalice` for framework-specific helpers.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Hybrid Framework Model:** The application successfully combines AWS Chalice (for serverless deployment and routing) with patterns from FastAPI (like using Pydantic `BaseModel` for data validation), creating a robust and type-safe API.
- **Automated Workflows:** The use of a `Makefile` for common commands (`install`, `run`, `deploy`) indicates a preference for simplifying and standardizing development and operational tasks.
- **Explicit Configuration:** Configuration is managed via environment variables, with a `.env-example` file providing a clear template for developers.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

- The project is mature enough to have a variety of endpoints and a defined deployment process but is now entering a phase where formalizing documentation and testing is crucial for long-term stability.
- The combination of Chalice and Serverless Framework (`serverless.yml`) suggests a need to manage both Python-level and infrastructure-level configurations carefully.
